# **Password Generator Using Python**

```yaml
import random
import string

def generate_password(min_length, numbers=True, special_characters=True):
    letters = string.ascii_letters
    digits = string.digits
    special = string.punctuation

    print(letters, digits, special)

generate_password(10)

So we need to combine all of these to one strong password

You will need to install the cryptography package, which is used for encrypting and securely storing your passwords. This is specified in the requirements.txt file I provided.
To install this package, you'll need to run:
Copypip install cryptography
Or as mentioned in the instructions:
Copypip install -r requirements.txt

and create a file called password storage to store pawd
